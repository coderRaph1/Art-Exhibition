# Events Platform

## Context (real or imagined business situation)

A small community business has reached out to you to create a platform where they can create and share events with members of the community. A member of the community can add the event they signed up for to their personal calendar. Some of these events are offered for free, however others are paid for either with a set amount or a pay as you feel charge.  

## Assumptions and prerequisites 

1. You can use a freely available API to bring in product data for the platform you will be creating, or you can come up with some data yourself (such as the events and their timings) but generating data is not the focus of the project. Either way, it is for you to research and decide on prior to starting the project whether and which API you will use.
2. You will need to sign up for services, such as Google Calendar API, on a free, developer account.

## High-level desired outcome

A platform where a business can share their events with members of the community, and community members can sign up for the events and add them to their calendar. This project can be a website or a mobile app, either needs to be readily viewable as hosted project. Please see further below for some suggestions around the hosting of a mobile app. 

## Minimum viable product

A mobile app or a website which allows:

1. Lists events for users
2. Users can sign up to an event
3. Users can add an event they have signed up for to their Google Calendar
4. Staff can do the above, as well as create an event

Consider how you will accomplish the differentiation between staff and users. You will likely need a way to log in as either staff or a user, in which case you _must_ provide both a test staff account and a test user account for us to review your work, as well as for further hiring partners. Please include this in your README. Failing to do so may result in us being unable to review your work.

## Non functional requirements 

- Built in JavaScript or TypeScript. 
- Responsive design.
- Accessibility taken into account.
- Considerations taken for the security of users log in and payment information.
- Hosted on a free distribution platform.
- The code should include clear and detailed documentation, which includes details on where the project is hosted and explicit steps on how it can be ran locally.
- For mobile applications, you can host the app on ExpoDev, whch will generate a QR code and a URL so that your project can be accessed via the ExpoDev app.
- For both mobile and web project, consider recording a video of you navigating through the app, sharing it on a free distribution platform and including a link in your README. This can be especially beneficial for a project. 

## Performance criteria

The app should clearly communicate errors to users, if they occur, or if content is still loading. The design should be clear and obvious as to how an event can be created or signed up for. 

## Non-binding tech suggestions

- Free API to give your events platform a theme (plants, books, films, animals, running, coffees, etc.)
- React or React Native
- TypeScript
- Google API
- Stripe, Google pay, or another payments portal with a free tier

## Possible extensions

- Payment platform integration (developer tier)
- Sending out confirmation emails when booked in for an event
- Social media integration
- Both a website and a mobile app
- Logging in using a Google account, or other social media

## Due date and completion considerations

The due date is to be advised, but not later than four weeks from commencement. Please note that the following are non negotiable for the fulfillment of the project:  
- you must host a project which covers the MVP;
- you must provide clear documentation summarising the project and explaining how the project can be ran locally;
- you must provide test staff and user accounts for us to review your work, and include them on your README.

Omitting these requirements can result in this project being unsuccessful.
