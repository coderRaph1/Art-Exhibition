# Exhibition Curation Platform

## Project Overview

Youâ€™ve been invited by a coalition of museums and universities to develop a platform where users can explore virtual exhibitions from combined collections of antiquities and fine art. This platform will serve researchers, students, and art enthusiasts, providing a searchable and interactive experience of the collections.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The platform (web app or progressive web app) must include the following features:

1. Users can search artworks across collections from **at least two** different Museum or University APIs.
2. Allow users to browse artworks, from a list view, with "Previous" and "Next" page navigation options to prevent loading of too many items at once.
3. Users can filter and/or sort artworks to make it easier to navigate through larger lists of items.
4. Display images and essential details about each artwork individually.
5. Enable users to create, add items to, and remove items from, personal _exhibition collections_ of saved artworks. A single user can have multiple exhibition collections.
6. Users can view their exhibitions and the saved items within each collection.

Refer to [Completion and Submission Requirements](#completion-and-submission-requirements) for more details.

## Tech Choices

- **Programming Languages**: Use **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**.
- **API Integration**: Research and choose at least two free museum or university APIs to retrieve collection data. Be sure to sign up for any necessary developer accounts on free tiers.
- **Hosting**: Use a free distribution platform (e.g., GitHub Pages or Netlify).
- Implement **security best practices** (e.g. for handling of API keys).

The following technologies and tools are **suggestions**, not requirements:

- **React** for the frontend.
- **TanStack** for managing API calls from the frontend.
- **TypeScript** Express server.

## UI Requirements

- Design should be **responsive** and adapt well across various screen sizes.
- Ensure **accessibility** for users with disabilities (e.g., support screen readers, keyboard navigation).
- The UI should clearly provide feedback on interactions, display **errors** (e.g., failed requests or missing fields) and show loading states when content is being fetched.
- Design should intuitively guide users to search, view, and create curated exhibitions.

## Completion and Submission Requirements

The due date will be provided, but it will be no later than four weeks after starting the project.

Your project must fulfill the following criteria:

1. The project should be **hosted** and publicly accessible (from a web browser).
2. **README Documentation** should include:
   - A summary of the project
     - (you may consider recording a **video walkthrough** of your platform, highlighting key features. Host this video on a free platform (e.g., YouTube) and include a link in your README.)
   - Clear instructions on how to run the project locally, including setup steps (e.g., installing dependencies and configuring environment variables).
3. Meet the [MVP requirements](#minimum-viable-product-mvp) outlined above.

Failure to meet these requirements may result in project rejection.

## Optional Extensions

If you complete the MVP and have time for additional features, consider implementing the following:

1. **User Accounts**: Save curated exhibition collections within user profiles. Consider a back-end solution for securely storing data, and provide access to a whitelisted test account.
2. **Social Media Integration**: Allow users to share exhibitions or individual artworks.
3. **Cross-Platform Access**: Develop both a website and a mobile app.
4. **Advanced Search Options**: Enable multiple filters for more refined search criteria.
=======
1. Context (real or imagined business situation)

You have always dreamt of being a curator of antiquities and fine artworks, and now you have been approached by a coalition of all kinds of museums and universities, who want to create viewer driven virtual exhibitions. This will be of great use to researchers, students, and art lovers alike. 

2. High-level desired outcome

Users of the platform can enter key terms or choose from presets to create an extensive virtual exhibition. The artwork should have some images and some information associated with them. Users can navigate between different artworks, and be provided with links where they can find out more information, and where they can see the artwork in person. 

3. Minimum viable product

Either a website or mobile app where a user can provide some search criteria to filter and sort artworks. Images and core information about the artwork are displayed when a user interacts with a thumbnail or other indicator of an artwork from a list. The user can select which artworks they want to include in an exhibition they are creating which persists for the duration of their session.

4. Possible extensions

- permanence of exhibitions through a user profile and a BE to save favourite search combinations
- unique shareable links 
- AR integration
- both a website and a mobile app
- social media integration
- multiple search and filter criteria 

5. Non functional requirement

- Built in React or React Native. 
- Responsive design.
- Accessibility taken into consideration.
- Fast loading of high quality media content, or indication of loading times to the user. 

6. Performance criteria

The app should clearly communicate to users errors, if they occur, or if content is still loading. The design should be clear and obvious as to how to create a curated exhibition and how to view it.  

7. Non-binding tech suggestions

Consider using: 

- React 
- React Native
- TypeScript

8. Due date

5 working days from the start date, spread over 5 weeks.
