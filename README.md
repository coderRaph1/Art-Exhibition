Project Overview

Youâ€™ve been invited by a coalition of museums and universities to develop a platform where users can explore virtual exhibitions from combined collections of antiquities and fine art. This platform will serve researchers, students, and art enthusiasts, providing a searchable and interactive experience of the collections.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The platform (web app or progressive web app) must include the following features:

    Users can search artworks across collections from at least two different Museum or University APIs.

    Allow users to browse artworks, from a list view, with "Previous" and "Next" page navigation options to prevent loading of too many items at once.

    Users can filter and/or sort artworks to make it easier to navigate through larger lists of items.

    Display images and essential details about each artwork individually.

    Enable users to create, add items to, and remove items from, personal exhibition collections of saved artworks. A single user can have multiple exhibition collections.
    
    Users can view their exhibitions and the saved items within each collection.

Refer to Completion and Submission Requirements for more details.
Tech Choices

    Programming Languages: Use JavaScript or TypeScript.
    API Integration: Research and choose at least two free museum or university APIs to retrieve collection data. Be sure to sign up for any necessary developer accounts on free tiers.
    Hosting: Use a free distribution platform (e.g., GitHub Pages or Netlify).
    Implement security best practices (e.g. for handling of API keys).

The following technologies and tools are suggestions, not requirements:

    React for the frontend.
    TanStack for managing API calls from the frontend.
    TypeScript Express server.

UI Requirements

    Design should be responsive and adapt well across various screen sizes.
    Ensure accessibility for users with disabilities (e.g., support screen readers, keyboard navigation).
    The UI should clearly provide feedback on interactions, display errors (e.g., failed requests or missing fields) and show loading states when content is being fetched.
    Design should intuitively guide users to search, view, and create curated exhibitions.
