# Exhibition Curation Platform

## Project Overview

Youâ€™ve been invited by a coalition of museums and universities to develop a platform where users can explore virtual exhibitions from combined collections of antiquities and fine art. This platform will serve researchers, students, and art enthusiasts, providing a searchable and interactive experience of the collections.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The platform (an Android app) must include the following features:

1. Users can search artworks across collections from **at least two** different Museum or University APIs.
2. Allow users to browse artworks, from a list view, with "Previous" and "Next" page navigation options to prevent loading of too many items at once.
3. Users can filter and/or sort artworks to make it easier to navigate through larger lists of items.
4. Display images and essential details about each artwork individually.
5. Enable users to add items to and remove items from temporary exhibitions of saved artworks.
6. Users can view their exhibitions and the saved items within each collection.

Refer to [Completion and Submission Requirements](#completion-and-submission-requirements) for more details.

## Tech Choices

- **Programming Languages**: Use **Java** or **Kotlin**.
- **API Integration**: Research and choose at least two free museum or university APIs to retrieve collection data. Be sure to sign up for any necessary developer accounts on free tiers.
- Implement **security best practices** (e.g. for storage of API keys, user login).

The following technologies and tools are **suggestions**, not requirements:

- **Android** for the frontend.
- **Kotlin** for a new challenge.
- **Google Calendar API** for calendar integration.
- **Google Sign-In** for OAuth social sign in

## UI Requirements

- Design should be **responsive** and adapt well across various mobile device screen sizes.
- Ensure **accessibility** for users with disabilities (e.g., support screen readers, voice navigation).
- The UI should clearly display **errors** (e.g., failed requests or missing fields) and show loading states when content is being fetched.
- Design should intuitively guide users to search, view, and create curated exhibitions.

## Completion and Submission Requirements

The due date will be provided, but it will be no later than four weeks after starting the project.

Your project must fulfill the following criteria:

1. The project should feature a fully documented backend API application and an Android Studio project for the frontend app.
2. **README Documentation** should include:
   - A summary of the project
     - (you may consider recording a **video walkthrough** of your platform, highlighting key features. Host this video on a free platform (e.g., YouTube) and include a link in your README.)
   - Clear instructions on how to run the project locally, including setup steps (e.g., installing dependencies, any necessary API keys, database setup, configuring application properties and environment variables).
3. Meet the [MVP requirements](#minimum-viable-product-mvp) outlined above.

Failure to meet these requirements may result in project rejection.

## Optional Extensions

If you complete the MVP and have time for additional features, consider implementing the following:

1. **User Accounts**: Save curated exhibition collections within user profiles. Consider a back-end solution for securely storing data, and provide access to a whitelisted test account.
2. **Social Media Integration**: Allow users to share exhibitions or individual artworks.
3. **Cross-Platform Access**: Develop both a mobile app and website.
4. **Advanced Search Options**: Enable multiple filters for more refined search criteria.
5. **Spring Security** implement full authentication using the Spring Security framework for secure communication between the backend API and frontend Android app.
